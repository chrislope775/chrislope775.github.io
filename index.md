### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was more on the beginner friendly. It has two parts, the first being about making calculations on BMR which is the Basal Metabolic Rate and the other being how many days are left. My favorite part was the first part which talked about Basal Metabolic Rate. This is the amount of energy a body expends while at rest. Looking back at it when I first started to work on it. It looked very difficult, but 8 or so weeks later it doesn't look that bad. I understand what the code does and how it works. Allowing me to write code better. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 consists of only one part. In this one part you must write a code which allows the person to park in a parking spot on a certain day and at a certain time. This allowed me to use the && and || symbols to make adjustment on when they can part. Although it was sort of difficult to understand the 24-hour clock I was able to push through and understand how it worked. 

* Lab 8

    For lab 8 there were two parts. The first part we had to write code on the average score for a set of numbers. The second part dealt with using nested for loops to print out this right triangle. My favorite part was part two because once I got it to work it looked wonderful. I never thought I could never do something like that with nested for loops.
